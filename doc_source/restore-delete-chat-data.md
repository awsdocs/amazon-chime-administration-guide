# Restoring and deleting chat messages<a name="restore-delete-chat-data"></a>

As an Enterprise account administrator, you can restore chat messages to your users within 30 days of setting or updating a chat retention period\. However, after the 30\-day grace period, all chat messages that fall under the retention period are permanently deleted, and new chat messages are permanently deleted as soon as they pass the retention period\.

**Note**  
During the 30\-day grace period, if you update a chat retention policy with a longer retention period or turn it off, chat messages that haven't passed the new retention period become visible again to users in your account\.

Chat messages are also permanently deleted from Amazon Chime when an Enterprise account administrator or a member of your account performs one or more of the following actions:
+ Deletes an Amazon Chime chat room
+ Ends an Amazon Chime meeting in which chat messages are present
