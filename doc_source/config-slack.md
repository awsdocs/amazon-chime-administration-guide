## Installing the Amazon Chime Meetings App for Slack on workspaces<a name="install-workspace"></a>

Installing the Amazon Chime Meetings App for Slack on a workspace enables users to start instant meetings and calls with other users in that workspace\. Users don't need an Amazon Chime user profile to use the Amazon Chime Meetings App for Slack\. They can log in with their Slack user profiles and start calls or meetings at any time\. If users need to conduct meetings with more than one other person, you must setup an Amazon Chime Team account and grant those additional users Pro permissions\. For more information about starting Amazon Chime calls and meetings, see [Using the Amazon Chime Meetings App for Slack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/using-slack.html) in the *Amazon Chime User Guide*\. For more information about setting up an Amazon Chime Team account, see [Associating workspaces with Amazon Chime Team accounts](#associate-with-team-acct) in this guide\.

## Associating workspaces with Amazon Chime Team accounts<a name="associate-with-team-acct"></a>

Associate your workspace with an Amazon Chime Team account to manage your users' permissions\. You can upgrade meeting hosts to Amazon Chime Pro so that they can start meetings with up to 250 attendees and 25 video tiles, and include phone numbers to dial in for audio\. Assign users Amazon Chime Basic permissions so they can start one\-on\-one meetings or join Amazon Chime meetings\. For more information, see [Amazon Chime Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/chime/pricing/)\.

**Note**  
If you associate an Amazon Chime Team account with your Slack workspace, users can sign in to Amazon Chime from the Amazon Chime Meetings App for Slack\. You can change this setting at any time\. For more information, see [Managing meeting settings](mtg-settings.md)\.

Before you can associate your Slack workspace with an Amazon Chime Team account, you must create an AWS account\. For more information about how to create an AWS account, see [Prerequisites](prereqs.md)\.
