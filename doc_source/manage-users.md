# Managing users<a name="manage-users"></a>

You use the Amazon Chime console to add and manage users\. You add users by inviting them\. As they accept your invitations, they appear under **Users**, which lists all the users in your account and their user details\. For more information, see [Viewing user details](user-details.md)\.

Administrators of accounts using **Login with Amazon** \(LWA\) also see options to manage permission tiers and remove users from an account\. These actions are managed through Active Directory or Okta, depending on which one of those you configure an account to use\. For more information, see [Managing user permissions and access](manage-access.md)\.
