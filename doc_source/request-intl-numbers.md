# Requesting international phone numbers<a name="request-intl-numbers"></a>

The steps in this section explain how to request international phone numbers for use with Amazon Chime\. As you go, remember that you can only use international numbers with the SIP Media Application Dial\-In product type\.

To purchase international numbers, regulations in many countries require you to have:
+ A local address
+ Proof of your identity, from Amazon Chime or our carriers

Allow 2\-6 weeks for Amazon Chime to fulfill your request\. For more information about the documentation requirements for various countries, see [Country requirements for phone numbers](phone-country-reqs.md)\. 

**To request international phone numbers in countries with identification requirements**

1. Do one of the following:
   + Open the [Amazon Chime console](https://chime.aws.amazon.com/) and choose **Support**, then **Submit request**\.
   + If you are an AWS Support customer, open the AWS Support Center page, sign in if necessary, and choose **Create case**, then **Technical support**\. For **Service**, choose **Chime**\.

1. For **Category**, choose **Other**\.

1. For **Subject**, enter **Provisioning international numbers**\.

1. For **Issue or Description**, enter the following:
   + Individual or Business
   + Name \(Individual Name or Business Name\)
   + Type of number \(Local or Toll\-Free\)
   + Country
   + Quantity of phone numbers

1. Do one of the following:
   + If you submit a support request from the Amazon Chime console, for **Email**, enter the email address associated with your Amazon Chime administrator account, then choose **Submit request**\.
   + If you create a case in the the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), for **Attachments**, select **Choose files** and attach the required documents\. For **Contact options**, select a contact method\. Optionally, for **Additional contacts**, enter email addresses of people to be notified of case status updates\.

   AWS Support responds to your support request to let you know whether the phone numbers can be provisioned\. You receive responses from AWS Support in one of the following ways:
   + If you submitted a support request from the Amazon Chime console, AWS Support emails the Operations contact specified under **Alternate Contacts** in the contact information for your AWS account\. For more information, see [Editing contact information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment.html#manage-account-payment-edit-contacts) in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide\.
   + If you created a case in the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), you receive responses based on your selected contact methods and any email addresses you entered for additional contacts\.

   Once the numbers are provisioned, you can view the numbers in the Amazon Chime console under **Calling, Phone number management, Inventory**\.

1. Use SIP rules to assign the phone numbers to the appropriate SIP media application\.
